# daddia.com website

This monorepo contains our website.

## Getting Started

To run any of the websites locally, you'll first need to install the dependencies
and packages. We recommend using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) to manage your dependencies.

```sh
pnpm install
```

If you take a peek in `package.json` you'll see we have a few different scripts
to run our apps. If you just want to run everything at once, you can just do:

```sh
pnpm site:dev
```
